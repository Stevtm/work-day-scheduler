# Work Day Scheduler

The purpose of this project was to create an application that allows the user to plan their work day by adding events to the calendar slots shown on the page.

The live application is deployed here: https://stevtm.github.io/work-day-scheduler/

## Application Functionality

The application is able to perform the following scheduling functions:

- Show the current date and time in the header.
- Allow the user to enter event details in the presented time slots.
- Colour-code time slots based to indicate whether they are in the past, present, or future.
- Allow the user to save events to local storage by pressing the 'lock' icon.
- Indicate whether an event has been saved to local storage by changing the lock icon from unlocked to locked.
- Reset all events for the current date when the date changes.
